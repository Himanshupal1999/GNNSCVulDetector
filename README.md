This repo is a python implementation of smart contract vulnerability detection using graph neural networks. 
In this research work, we focus on detecting three kinds of smart contract vulnerabilities (i.e., reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop).
All of the infinite loop types we concerned are implemented by Class C/C++ of [VNT](https://github.com/vntchain/go-vnt), 
while the smart contracts of reentrancy and timestamp dependence are wirrten by Solidity, i.e., [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/) smart contract. 

The ESC dataset consists of 40,932 smart contracts from Ethereum. 
Among the functions, around 5,013 functions possess at least one invocation to call.value, making them potentially affected by the reentrancy vulnerability. 
Around 4,833 functions contain the block.timestamp statement, making them susceptible to the timestamp dependence vulnerability.
The VSC dataset contains all the available 4,170 smart contracts collected from the VNT Chain network, which overall contain 13,761 functions. 
VNT Chain is an experimental public blockchain platform proposed by companies and universities from Singapore, China, and Australia.

## Requirements

#### Required Packages
* **python**3
* **TensorFlow**1.14.0 (tf2.0 is not supported)
* **keras**2.2.4 with TensorFlow backend
* **sklearn** for model evaluation
* **docopt** as a command-line interface parser 
* **go-vnt** as a vntchain platform support
* **go-ethereum** as a ethereum platform support

Run the following script to install the required packages.
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install scikit-learn
pip install docopt
```

### Required Dataset
For each dataset, we randomly pick 80% contracts as the training set while the remainings are utilized for the testing set. 
In the comparison, metrics accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score are all involved. In consideration of the distinct features of different platforms, 
experiments on reentrancy vulnerability and timestamp dependence vulnerability are conducted on the ESC dataset, 
while experiments on infinite loop vulnerability detection are conducted on the VSC dataset.

#### source code
Original smart contract source code stored in google drive:

Ethereum smart contracts:  [Etherscan_contract](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h9aFFSsL7mK4NmVJd4So7IJlFj9u0HRv)

Vntchain smart contacts: [Vntchain_contract](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FTb__ERCOGNGM9dTeHLwAxBLw7X5Td4v)

Here, we provide a [tool](https://github.com/Messi-Q/Crawler) for crawling source code from Etherscan, which is developed in Aug 2018. 
If out of date, you can refer and make the corresponding improvements.
